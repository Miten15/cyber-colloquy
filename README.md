### Key Improvements:

1. **Technology Badges:**
   - Added badges for **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vercel**. Badges help communicate the stack visually at a glance.

2. **Centered Project Image:**
   - The main image is now centered with a width of `70%` for better visual appeal.

3. **Clean Structure:**
   - The content is now visually clearer, with sections like **How to Use**, **Deployment**, and **Author** separated and formatted for better readability.

These visual improvements should make the `README.md` more engaging and user-friendly. Let me know if youâ€™d like further refinements!
